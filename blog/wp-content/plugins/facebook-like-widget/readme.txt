== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it free? =

Absolutely.

= Why use this plugin? =

This plugin automatically ads the Facebook like button so you don't have 
to manually do it for each post or page.

= Why is there so much whitespace under the like button =

Facebook has this space to show faces of Facebook members who liked your post or page. 
If you disable show faces in the settings it will get rid of that space.
