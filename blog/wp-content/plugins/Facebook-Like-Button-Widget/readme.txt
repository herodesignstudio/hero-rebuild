Add a Facebook 'Like' Button Widget to your post pages. Increase visitors!

== Description ==

This is a very simple Facebook Like Widget. It adds the blue thumbs up button from Facebook for your friends and visitors to like. It will also display the facebook profile image on your wordpress post page right after they click the "Like".

Additionally, it will add it to their Facebook Profile's Recent Activity. Example "AJ likes 'A pretty girl became high after wisdom tooth removal. Is this real life?' on allanjosephbatac.com.".

This increases your traffic as well as interaction with your visitors.

A very simple plugin for bloggers who don't want to tinker the Wordpress code. Simply activate on your Plugins panel and it should be good to go on your post pages. That easy!

If you want to beautify the Facebook Like Widget and you know CSS. I've made a CSS id named 'facebook_like'.
